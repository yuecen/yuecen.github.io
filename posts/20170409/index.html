			<h1>Cohort analysis</h1>

				<p>When it comes to retention, cohort analysis is a common way to measure how users like your products. I helped our company to build it with our log system Elasticsearch. I decided using a faster way to build it, that means I might be abandoning some components. Cutting out the storage part is a sensible consideration. Just calculate retention rates, and show the results to my partners in a convenient way, sending the visualized data by Slack.</p>
<p>Before I started coding, I read many posts, trying to figure out how to build it. Some articles were too general to explain the whole process. Fortunately, there was a <a href="https://www.appboy.com/blog/calculate-retention-rate/">post</a> I can clearly understand what it wanted to tell us for cohort analysis. So I recommend you to read it if you wanted to build a cohort analysis from scratch. Here, I won&rsquo;t say too many details on calculation process, just talk about three components during implement.</p>
<p><strong><em>An unified docker image</em></strong>. For all scripts of cohort analysis, I used an unified docker image to run them. It&rsquo;s really easy to manage and run the various scripts by a docker image with the same version of packages. I used Python virtualenv to build a virtual environment for developing the scripts, and then used the docker image to run the scripts in our production environment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cohort analysis</em></strong>. In the scripts, selecting time frame that make a little bit annoying for me. I have to be very careful to make sure each cohort within the correct time frame, avoiding the results that were affected by a leap year or an intercalary month.</p>
<p><strong><em>Notification by Slack</em></strong>. After a result of cohort analysis is calculated by the scripts, the result will be converted into a visualized output, an ascii table, to send to the Slack channels. The output in the retention channel looks like:</p>

</code></pre><p>Using this simple way to receive your retention rate that have some advantages: First, your partners get latest information of retention immediately by Slack notification. Second, you can get another retention rate with other conditions by a search command on your log systems. For example, if I wanted to know how gender effect retention rate, I just add a search condition <code>gender:female</code> to our log system Elasticsearch. Third, your logs still are kept in your site.</p>
