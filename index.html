		I recently need to convert some files with pdf or pptx format into jpg format for our product. The concrete scenario is that when the service gets a file from a caller, the service is going to extract text information and convert files into images, then return them to the caller. Building this service have faced many problems, so I wanted to take some notes and explain clearly for it.

	<div>
		I was learning Vue.js last weekend. The reason I learned is that I not only wanted to know a programming language but also wanted to solve my real problems from one of my friends. Some of my friends work at department stores, they&rsquo;ve been facing the same problem of calculation. So I made a web page with an algorithm to fix this problem. They were so happy, their time can be saved by what I made.

	<div>
		When it comes to retention, cohort analysis is a common way to measure how users like your products. I helped our company to build it with our log system Elasticsearch. I decided using a faster way to build it, that means I might be abandoning some components. Cutting out the storage part is a sensible consideration. Just calculate retention rates, and show the results to my partners in a convenient way, sending the visualized data by Slack.

	<time>03.04.2017 22:45</time>
	
	<div>
		My colleagues and I have made some marketing activities to promote our website. There were three main approaches we used. The first was to post a contrived content on social platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, attracting people click the links for leading to our website, the second was to send emails to people who starred a repository on GitHub, so they might like our website. Third, we reached a blogger (influencer) for a post.

	<div>
		I have been working for a startup company in a few months. Our product is a web site where people can write and read posts with their mind flow by a mindmap-like interface. The most of my job is to visualize log, helping ourselves to understand how users use our web site. Meanwhile, I also do some temporary tasks like adding a few seed data, or writing scripts for sending email to people in the early period.
